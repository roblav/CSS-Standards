#### Minimise the use of element selectors 

Selectors that contain elements tightly coupled the CSS to specific markup. It is not a safe assumption that the semantics of the content will never change so authors should prefer classes which exist independent of markup and create more flexible CSS.

#### Do not use location based selectors

A location based selector is a selector that changes a modules appearance based on its location (content area, side bar, header etc).  Where a module has different appearances it is better to use a module subclass.  If the appearance and/or content is very different it would be better to use a different module

#### Do not use ID's in CSS Selectors

It is never safe to assume there will only ever be one of something on a page so do not use ID's for CSS.  Id's are much better used as javascript hooks so use them for this instead.

#### Use dashes to separate words

CSS properties do not use underscores or camel case, they use dashes.  Do the same with classes 

### Selectors

#### Include a single space before the opening brace of a ruleset.

Example code:
    
    .book-navigation .page-next {
    }
    
    .book-navigation .page-previous {
    }
    

A blank line should be placed between each group, section, or block of multiple selectors of logically related styles.

#### Multiple selectors should each be on a single line, with no space after each comma. 

    #forum td.posts,
    #forum td.topics,
    #forum td.replies,
    #forum td.pager {

#### Selectors should be 4 or less levels deep

Long complex selector chains spawn specificity wars and are slower for the browser to evaluate.  Its unlikely you _need_ to use a selector more than 4 levels deep.  If it is, consider adding additional classes to the markup to enable a shorter selector length.

Long selector chains also have an impact on the page load, however it is minor. In other words, consider selector performance but donâ€™t waste too much time on it.
